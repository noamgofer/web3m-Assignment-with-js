## process:
i created an html web  using Valila JS and CSS
i fetched the data from externall API (Coingecko) and inject only the relevant data into an empty array.
i made a list of the top NFT and put links for more information
i build an ApexChart chart from duplicated data array, 
i added range input for filtering the chart by the coin's market cap.
i put an ivent on the inputs to make a dynamic range and chart

* i had some rendering issues in the dynamic chart filter (in comment//).
